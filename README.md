# Infernet Node (JavaScript/TypeScript)

This repository contains an ongoing JavaScript/TypeScript port of the original Python-based Ritual Infernet Node (v1.4.0), which can be found [here](https://github.com/ritual-net/infernet-node).

The core functionality from the original Python implementation has been adapted to JavaScript/TypeScript. However, due to inherent differences between the programming languages and available libraries, this port is not intended to be a "one-to-one" translation.

If you encounter significant discrepancies between this implementation and the original Python version that impact functionality, please open a GitHub issue. When doing so, clearly describe the discrepancy and, if possible, propose a solution or recommended adjustment.
